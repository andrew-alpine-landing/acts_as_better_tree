# ActsAsBetterTree

An alternative to nested_sets and acts_as_tree. Designed to be a drop in replacement for acts_as_tree. Replaces betternestedset without the slow inserts when dealing with a large dataset. Used by upillar.com on a dataset of over 900,000 categories with no slow downs. In tests it shows a 285% speed increase on inserts with a dataset of 100k categories. As datasets become larger its insert speed stays about the same when nested_sets become slower. In all of my tests read speeds have been comparable with nested sets on everything but all_children which is inperceptibly slower on a dataset of 100k than betternestedset.


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'acts_as_better_tree'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install acts_as_better_tree

## Usage

    Required fields are parent_id, root_id, csv_ids.

    create_table :categories do |t|
     t.column :root_id, :integer
     t.column :parent_id, :integer
     t.column :csv_ids, :string
     t.column :name, :string
    end

    If upgrading from acts_as_tree just add root_id and csv_ids and run Category.build_csv_ids!

    class Category < ActiveRecord::Base
        acts_as_better_tree :order => "name"
    end

    Example:
    root
    \_ child1
        \_ subchild1
        \_ subchild2

    root      = Category.create("name" => "root")
    child1    = root.children.create("name" => "child1")
    subchild1 = child1.children.create("name" => "subchild1")

    root.parent   # => nil
    child1.parent # => root
    root.children # => [child1]
    root.children.first.children.first # => subchild1
